## Country Clustering Analysis

### Overview

This project utilizes **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to analyze and cluster countries based on various socio-economic indicators. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and groupings that can aid in understanding global trends and decision-making.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing raw data for effective clustering.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Implementation of algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Visualization**: Clear and intuitive visual representations of clustered data.
- **Insights**: Key findings about the clusters, including their socio-economic implications.

### Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **Notebooks**: Step-by-step Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model implementation.
- **Results**: Visualizations and final clustered outputs.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the methodology and results.
